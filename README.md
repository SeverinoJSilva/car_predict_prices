- About Dataset
- This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars with high accuracy using decision tree regression and random forest regression models. a comprehensive dataset containing various car features like model, year, km_driven, fuel type, and ownership history. By analyzing these features and their relationships with the selling price, I aim to build a robust and generalizable model that can inform buyers, sellers, and other stakeholders in the used car market.
